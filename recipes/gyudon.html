    <p>Gyudon is a Japanese beef bowl consisting of thinly sliced fatty beef and onions in a lightly sweet mixture of mirin and soy sauce. Serve it over rice with a fried egg for a simple and delicious meal!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul><li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>1 pound very thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup dashi stock</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!</li>
            <li>When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
        </ol>
